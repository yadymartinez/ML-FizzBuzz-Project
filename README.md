Machine Learning solution for Fizz Buzz problem
# Fizz Buzz Problem Description 
Write a program that given the numbers from 1 to 100 print “None” for each number. But for multiples of the three print “Fizz” instead of “None” and for the multiples of five print  “Buzz”. For numbers  which are multiples of both three an five print “FizzBuzz”.
There are many approaches to solving this problem. The most popular and well-known solution to this problem involves using conditional statements with a loop 
1. If the number (x) is divisible by three, the result must be “Fizz”
2. If the number (x) is divisible by five, the result must be “Buzz”
3. If the number (x) is divisible by both three and five, the result must be “FizzBuzz” 
4. Else the result must be “None”
# FizzBuzz solution using Machine Learning approaches with Logistic Regression algorithm
    • Structure the problem as a multi-class classification problem 
    • Generate the fizzbuzz data 
    • Divide the data into train and test
    • Preprocessing data
    • Build a logistic regression model form sklearn library 
    • Report the accuracy score with test data (1-100)
    • Select the best perform on different classification algorithms using a ten fold-cross validation
